## Review Guidelines

### Terms and Conditions

As a developer of applications for the App Store you are bound by the terms of the [Program License Agreement (PLA)](https://developer.apple.com/), Human Interface Guidelines (HIG), and any other licenses or contracts between you and Apple. The following rules and examples are intended to assist you in gaining acceptance for your App in the App Store, not to amend or remove provisions from any other agreement.

### Functionality

1.	Apps that crash will be rejected
2.	Apps that exhibit bugs will be rejected
3.	Apps that do not perform as advertised by the developer will be rejected
4.	Apps that include undocumented or hidden features inconsistent with the description of the App will be rejected
5.	Apps that use non-public APIs will be rejected
6.	Apps that read or write data outside its designated container area will be rejected
7.	Apps that download code in any way or form will be rejected
8.	Apps that install or launch other executable code will be rejected
9.	Apps that are “beta”, “demo”, “trial”, or “test” versions will be rejected
10.	iPhone Apps must also run on iPad without modification, at iPhone resolution, and at 2X iPhone 3GS resolution
11.	Apps that duplicate Apps already in the App Store may be rejected, particularly if there are many of them, such as fart, burp, flashlight, and Kama Sutra Apps.
12.	Apps that are not very useful, unique, are simply web sites bundled as Apps, or do not provide any lasting entertainment value may be rejected
13.	Apps that are primarily marketing materials or advertisements will be rejected
14.	Apps that are intended to provide trick or fake functionality that are not clearly marked as such will be rejected
15.	Apps larger than 50MB in size will not download over cellular networks (this is automatically prohibited by the App Store)
16.	Multitasking Apps may only use background services for their intended purposes: VoIP, audio playback, location, task completion, local notifications, etc.
17.	Apps that browse the web must use the iOS WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript
18.	Apps that encourage excessive consumption of alcohol or illegal substances, or encourage minors to consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes, will be rejected
19.	Apps that provide incorrect diagnostic or other inaccurate device data will be rejected
20.	Developers “spamming” the App Store with many versions of similar Apps will be removed from the iOS Developer Program
21.	Apps that are simply a song or movie should be submitted to the iTunes store. Apps that are simply a book should be submitted to the iBookstore.
22.	Apps that arbitrarily restrict which users may use the App, such as by location or carrier, may be rejected
23.	Apps must follow the iOS Data Storage Guidelines or they will be rejected
24.	Apps that are offered in Newsstand must comply with schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the Developer Program License Agreement or they will be rejected
25.	Apps that display Apps other than your own for purchase or promotion in a manner similar to or confusing with the App Store will be rejected
